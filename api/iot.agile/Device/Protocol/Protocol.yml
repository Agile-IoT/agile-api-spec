ProtocolDevice:
  description: |
    List all devices a Protocol knows about.
    The list is updated by the Discover method.
    Devices may be provisioned programmatically during the initialization phase.
  access: [r, s]
  type: Array

    type: Object
    fields:
      name: String
      id: String
      status:
        type: Enum
        fields:
          - CONNECTED
          - DISCONNECTED

ProtocolStatus:
  description: |
    Identify a status of the Protocol, indicating if operational (AVAILABLE) or
    if for some reason further user-side checks are required.
  type: Enum
  fields:
    - AVAILABLE
    - NOT_CONFIGURED
    - UNAVAILABLE
    - DISABLED
    - FATAL

ProtocolProfile:
  group: Device
  description: |
    A Protocol set of settings that translate human readable properties
    to actual Protocol implementation details.

    For example, the user request the temperature value over a BLE connected
    device and the Protocol receive all the specific informations (like
    services and characteristics ids) to enable the data reading.
  type: Object*

iot.agile.Protocol:
  group: Device
  description: |
    A Protocol object abstract operations over a specific protocol implementation.
    Every Device has one Protocol used to establish and use a communication exchange.

  Status:
    type: ProtocolStatus
