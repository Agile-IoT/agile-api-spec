iot.agile.ProtocolManager:

  description: |
    The ProtocolManager list the managed protocols in the gateway. From this
    interface is possible to add and remove protocols and start/stop multiprotocol discovery.
    The discovery process will list all found devices under the `Devices` property.
    Those discovered devices may be added to the [DeviceManager](#iot.agile.DeviceManager) to be
    configured and made operational.
