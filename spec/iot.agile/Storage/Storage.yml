iot.agile.Storage:
  description: |
    The Storage component offer an abstraction for Devices to store and fetch data
    in a generic way.
    Write operations happens on all the enabled Drivers;
    Failure of a single Driver doesn't make faile the whole write but only reported
    Read operations work on a default driver, if specified, which acts as preferred source.
    In case default is not available or fails, read will be executed in cascade on
    the enabled Driver. If none replies the operation fails.
